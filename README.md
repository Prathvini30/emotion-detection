Emotion Detection
Overview

The Emotion Detection project is a machine learning application designed to analyze and classify human emotions from facial expressions using deep learning techniques. This project leverages a pre-trained model to identify emotions such as happiness, sadness, anger, surprise, fear, disgust, and neutral states.

Features

Emotion Classification: Detects and classifies facial expressions into seven distinct emotions.

Real-Time Analysis: Capable of processing live video streams for immediate emotion recognition.

User-Friendly Interface: Built with Streamlit for an intuitive and interactive user experience.

Pre-trained Model: Utilizes a MobileNetV2 model fine-tuned on a facial emotion dataset for accurate predictions.

Technologies Used

Python: Programming language for backend development.

Streamlit: Framework for building the interactive web interface.

TensorFlow/Keras: Deep learning libraries for model implementation.

OpenCV: Library for video capture and image processing.

Hugging Face Transformers: For advanced NLP tasks (if applicable).
