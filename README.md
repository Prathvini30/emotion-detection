Emotion Detection (Text-Based)
Overview

The Emotion Detection project is a machine learning web application that detects the emotions conveyed in user-written text. Users can type sentences, and the system predicts emotions such as happy, sad, angry, surprise, fear, disgust, or neutral.

The project features a user-friendly Streamlit interface and a pre-trained NLP model to classify emotions accurately.
